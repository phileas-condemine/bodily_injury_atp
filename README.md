# About the different courts

<ul>
<li>
First and second degree instances are working on the case itself.
<li>
Breaking court is higher than first & second degree instances, its role is to judge the decision of the second degree instance.
<br>
If the breaking court breaks the second degree instance decision, then the judgement is <b>sent back</b> to a second degree instance.
<li>Administrative court instances handle trials where <a href="https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F2025"> public administration is involved </a>
</ul>
